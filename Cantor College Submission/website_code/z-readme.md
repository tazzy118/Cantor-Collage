Indicate whether you added a database. Was it stored on a local company of XAMPP or did you build it on the VM?

I did attempt to add a database but I had trouble connecting it to my website. XAMPP was not working for me, so 
I tried using a PDO with php, but it was cooperating. 
I did attemp it though in my courses/database.php & cantor-college/courses.html.

If you built a database placed an 'SQL dump' in the 'database' folder:
done.
